This repository contains three folders:

- Force Calculation Only: This is the code used for the verification part in the paper. The code in this folder computes
the acoustic radiation force for a helix in the standing wave field. It does not simulate the trajectories.

- Standing Wave Simulation: The code in this folder simulates a magnetically actuated helical swimmer in a standing wave field
over time in bulk swimming conditions. Main code of interest is traj_helix_standingwave.m

- Travelling Wave Simulation: The code in this folder simulates a magnetically actuated helical swimmer in a travelling wave field
over time in bulk swimming conditions. Main code of interest is traj_helix_travellingwave.m

The codes themselves have many comments, check them out. Also check our paper covering this study (info below).
