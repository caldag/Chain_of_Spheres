- This folder contains the codes for the verification part in the paper (for nylon).
- helix_comp_main computes the radiation force using the chain-of-spheres approach in a standing wave field.
- The .txt files contain the forces evaluated from the finite-element-based model.
- You can modify it as you need to build any sphere composition and compute the force.
- Check the codes, they have some explanatory comments! Also check our article if you are confused.
- And you can always write to hakan.caldag@sabanciuniv.edu. I will gladly try to help.
